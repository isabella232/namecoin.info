        <description>&lt;p&gt;Namecoin Core 0.13.99-name-tab-beta1, which has been listed on our Beta Downloads page for a few months, has demonstrated itself to be stable enough that &lt;a href=&quot;/download/&quot;&gt;it is now listed on the main Downloads page&lt;/a&gt;.  Huge thanks to our Lead C++ GUI Engineer Brandon Roberts for his work on this.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Namecoin&#39;s Jeremy Rand will be a speaker at ICANN58</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ICANN has invited a Namecoin developer to speak at the ICANN58 meeting on March 11-16 2017 in Copenhagen, and I’m happy to say that I’ve accepted their invitation.  Since I’m well aware that this may be surprising to some readers, I think it’s beneficial to everyone to announce it here, and give some details about why I’ll be attending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this post will be in the excellent Q&amp;amp;A-style format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-icann-invite-you&quot;&gt;Why did ICANN invite you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my understanding, I was invited because of a perception that there was a lack of understanding and dialogue between ICANN and Namecoin about specifically what the goals of each group were.  The hope is that by encouraging discussion between ICANN and Namecoin, the groups will have a more accurate idea of what the other is doing and what common interests we might have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not news to me that ICANN has an interest in Namecoin; an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iti-report-15may14-en.pdf&quot;&gt;ICANN panel report&lt;/a&gt; favorably mentioned us.  However, I admit that I was (pleasantly) surprised to receive this invitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-think-of-icann-and-dns&quot;&gt;What do you think of ICANN and DNS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be totally honest, I’m not really very knowledgeable about how ICANN operates.  I hope to gain some knowledge on this subject at the meeting.  That said, I’ve heard that ICANN has some political issues.  (Indeed, if James Seng’s comments in the aforementioned report are any indication, this is a recognized issue by ICANN participants, not just from the outside.)  This is really not surprising, and as far as I know, it’s not due to any kind of nefarious motivation by ICANN or any people within ICANN.  My take is that ICANN’s political issues are likely to be simply because ICANN is very large, and large centralized entities are inevitably going to have political issues.  If, in an alternate reality, OpenNIC were wildly successful and ended up as large as ICANN is today, I predict that OpenNIC would end up with political issues too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;isnt-that-just-icanns-own-fault-for-being-centralized&quot;&gt;Isn’t that just ICANN’s own fault for being centralized?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not ICANN’s fault, it’s the reality of the laws of math.  When DNS and ICANN were created, everyone believed that decentralized global consensus was impossible (and this belief was well-supported by a proof by Lamport dating back to the 1970’s).  It wasn’t until Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin that anyone had any credible reason to believe that decentralized global consensus was solvable, and it wasn’t until Appamatto and Aaron Swartz proposed BitDNS and Nakanames 2 years later that anyone really seriously considered applying a Nakamoto blockchain to a DNS-like system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-namecoin-exists-now-doesnt-that-make-dns-obsolete&quot;&gt;But Namecoin exists now; doesn’t that make DNS obsolete?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really.  Namecoin makes a number of design tradeoffs in order to achieve decentralization.  Compared to DNS, Namecoin has significantly worse security against run-of-the-mill malware, significantly worse privacy against your nosy friends/neighbors/employer, and significantly worse resistance to squatting and trademark infringement, to list just a few.  These are open research problems for Namecoin-like systems, whereas DNS has long ago solved them.  I work on Namecoin because Namecoin also has some advantages over DNS, and I think there is a significant user base who want those advantages enough that they are willing to cope with the downsides.  But that doesn’t mean that DNS is obsolete, or that I expect Namecoin to replace DNS anytime soon.  If, in the future, Namecoin eventually solves those open research problems, and as a result replaces DNS, that’d be cool as heck from my point of view, but if that ever happens, I think it will be far enough in the future that it’s not worth worrying about right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;namecoin-has-almost-no-funding-if-you-had-the-budget-of-the-dns-industry-wouldnt-those-open-research-problems-have-been-solved-by-now&quot;&gt;Namecoin has almost no funding; if you had the budget of the DNS industry, wouldn’t those open research problems have been solved by now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would be inconsistent with the definition of “open research problem”.  Funding would certainly help us spend more time tackling those problems, but there’s no guarantee that the problems are even solvable.  Also, since no one is offering to give us such a budget, there’s not really much point in speculating here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-you-being-paid-to-attend&quot;&gt;Are you being paid to attend?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICANN is covering my travel expenses.  (Naturally, I wasn’t going to ask NMDF to pay for me to travel.  We don’t have anywhere near enough funding for that.)  Other than that, I’m not being paid to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;has-icann-asked-for-any-control-or-influence-on-namecoin&quot;&gt;Has ICANN asked for any control or influence on Namecoin?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course not.  (And if they did, I would decline – as I assume would the other devs.)  It’s entirely standard to talk to people working on related projects; it doesn’t imply any desire to influence or control those projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-you-concerned-that-this-will-be-spun-by-market-manipulators-as-some-kind-of-sell-out&quot;&gt;Are you concerned that this will be spun by market manipulators as some kind of sell-out?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m reasonably confident that market manipulators will try to profit by spinning this in some way, but that’s not anything new.  We’ve already seen market manipulators try to make money by alleging a sell-out, based on everything from our application to Google Summer of Code in 2014 and 2015, to me getting a college scholarship from Google in 2013, to our collaboration with GNUnet, I2P, and Tor to try to register the .bit TLD as a special-use name via IETF.  Those same market manipulators will, I assume, use this the same way, probably with the same minimal level of success that they had previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had any interest in spending my time worrying about market manipulators, I’d be in a different line of work, making way more money than I’m making right now.  The best I can do is be transparent about this, so that it’s obvious to anyone who does an ounce of research that nothing nefarious occurred.  Transparency FTW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-you-publicly-post-your-presentation-slides&quot;&gt;Will you publicly post your presentation slides?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, why not?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Namecoin&#39;s Jeremy Rand will be a speaker at QCon London 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a result of an invitation from Riccardo Spagni (AKA fluffypony of &lt;a href=&quot;https://getmonero.org/&quot;&gt;Monero&lt;/a&gt;), I will be speaking at the “Practical Cryptography &amp;amp; Blockchains: Beyond the Hype” track at &lt;a href=&quot;https://qconlondon.com/&quot;&gt;QCon London 2017&lt;/a&gt; (March 6-8 2017).  My talk is entitled “Case Study: Alternate Blockchains”.  I will also be on a panel discussion alongside Paul Sztorc, David Vorick, Elaine Ou, Peter Todd, and Riccardo Spagni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that a video of my talk will be published by QCon.  Assuming that that’s correct, I will post a link here when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to Riccardo for inviting me, and to the QCon organizers for putting on the conference and covering my travel expenses.  Looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lightweight SPV Lookups: Initial Beta</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/DecentralizedWeb20160609pt1?start=21490&quot;&gt;my lightning talk at Decentralized Web Summit 2016&lt;/a&gt; (and if you didn’t, shame on you – go watch it right now along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/decentralizedwebsummit2016?&amp;amp;sort=publicdate&quot;&gt;the other talks&lt;/a&gt;!), you’ll remember that I announced SPV name lookups were working.  I’m happy to announce that that code is now published &lt;em&gt;in preliminary form&lt;/em&gt; on GitHub, and binaries are available for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download it at the &lt;a href=&quot;/download/betas/&quot;&gt;Beta Downloads&lt;/a&gt; page.  Once installed, it’s basically a drop-in replacement for Namecoin Core for any application that does name lookups (such as ncdns).  Test reports are greatly appreciated so that we can do a proper release sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial syncup using a residential clearnet cable modem connection takes between 5 minutes and 10 minutes, depending on the settings.  (It is probably feasible to improve this.)  Lookup latency for &lt;code&gt;name_show&lt;/code&gt; varies from 2 seconds to 4 milliseconds, depending on the settings.  (It is also probably feasible to improve this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work wouldn’t have been possible without the work of some very awesome people whom I need to thank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I need to thank Ross Nicoll from &lt;a href=&quot;http://dogecoin.com/&quot;&gt;Dogecoin (warning: non-TLS link)&lt;/a&gt; for creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dogecoin/libdohj&quot;&gt;libdohj&lt;/a&gt;, an altcoin abstraction library that has prevented Namecoin from needing to maintain a fork of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoinj.github.io/&quot;&gt;BitcoinJ&lt;/a&gt;.  We’re using the same AuxPoW implementation from libdohj that Dogecoin is using – a fitting repayment, since Dogecoin Core uses the same AuxPoW implementation that Daniel Kraft wrote for Namecoin Core.  We look forward to continuing to work with Ross and the other excellent people at Dogecoin on areas of shared interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I need to thank Sean Gilligan for his work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/msgilligan/bitcoinj-addons&quot;&gt;bitcoinj-addons&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of tools that includes a JSON-RPC server implemented using BitcoinJ, which can substitute for Bitcoin Core.  Sean is also a big Namecoin enthusiast.  (I also finally got to meet Sean in person at DWS.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I need to thank Marius Hanne, operator of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webbtc.com/&quot;&gt;webbtc.com block explorer&lt;/a&gt;.  The SPV lookup client currently is capable of using webbtc.com for extra efficiency (either for checking the height of blocks to download over P2P, or for downloading merkle proofs).  Marius has been incredibly helpful at customizing the webbtc.com API for this purpose.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mhanne/block_browser&quot;&gt;webbtc.com is under a free software license (AGPLv3)&lt;/a&gt;, so you can run your own instance if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: this is a beta, &lt;em&gt;for testing purposes only&lt;/em&gt;.  Don’t use this for situations where incorrect name responses could lead to results that you aren’t willing to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, some notes about security.  SPV protects you from being served expired name data, and protects you from being served unexpired name data that isn’t part of the longest chain.  However, the SPV modes other than &lt;code&gt;leveldbtxcache&lt;/code&gt; (see the documentation) don’t protect you from being served outdated name data that hasn’t yet expired, nor does it protect you from being served false nonexistence responses, nor does it protect you from someone logging which names you look up.  We made an intentional design decision to trust webbtc.com here, rather than the Namecoin P2P network, because the P2P network is unauthenticated, trivially easy to wiretap, and trivially easy to Sybil.  &lt;code&gt;leveldbtxcache&lt;/code&gt; mode avoids these isues, although it takes about twice as long to synchronize.  We have plans to add further improvements in these areas as well.  SPV also doesn’t protect you from attackers with a large amount of hashpower.  As with Bitcoin, a major reason that miners can’t easily attack end users is because there are enough full nodes on the network to keep the miners honest.  If you have the ability to run Namecoin Core (syncup time of a few hours, and a few GB of storage), you should do so – you’ll have better security for yourself, and you’ll be improving the security of other users who can’t run a full node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun testing!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Decentralized Web Summit Recap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As was mentioned on the forum and /r/Namecoin, I represented Namecoin at the Decentralized Web Summit at the Internet Archive in San Francisco, June 6 - June 10.  Lots of awesomeness occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in a panel on naming and identity systems on Wednesday.  Other panelists were Christopher Allen (Blockstream), Muneeb Ali (Blockstack), and Joachim Lohkamp (Jolocom); Chelsea Barabas (MIT Center for Civic Media) moderated.  The panel had a diverse set of perspectives, and I think the discussion was informative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, I did a lightning talk.  The talk briefly introduced Namecoin, and then went on to new developments, specifically new announcements about HTTPS and SPV.  The lightning talk concluded with an invitation to talk to us about collaboration, and a plug for my workshop (which immediately followed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop was basically an intro to actually using Namecoin.  I walked the attendees through registering domain names and identities, viewing domain names with ncdns, and logging into websites with NameID.  We had some minor technical issues during the workshop (which is to be expected), but nothing too bad.  At the end of the workshop, I showed a demo of the TLS code working.  (Major thanks go out to fellow Namecoin developers Brandon Roberts, Jonas Östman, Joseph Bisch, and Cassini for helping me put together the workshop.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, I didn’t fly to San Francisco &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to do a panel, lightning talk, and workshop.  A major goal was to talk to as many other projects as possible to see where we could collaborate.  (No single project is going to decentralize the entire Web, but working together, we might have a shot.)  I won’t list all the conversations I had on this post, because I want people to be able to talk freely to me at conferences without being worried that the conversation will be posted for the world to see, but the number of orgs I talked to stands at at least 23.  Hopefully we’ll be able to announce some results of these conversations in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, it wouldn’t be an event by the Internet Archive without archived videos, so here are some of the highlights that Namecoiners will find particularly interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/DecentralizedWeb20160609pt1?start=21490&quot;&gt;Lightning Talk: Jeremy Rand of Namecoin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/DecentralizedWeb20160607pt3?start=3015&quot;&gt;Builder’s Day Interview: Tamas Kocsis of ZeroNet (uses Namecoin)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/DecentralizedWeb20160609pt1?start=10987&quot;&gt;Lightning Talk: Tamas Kocsis of ZeroNet (uses Namecoin)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/DecentralizedWeb20160608pt1?start=11888&quot;&gt;Naming and User Identities Panel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was an excellent event.  I highly recommend watching all the other non-Namecoin content as well: &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/decentralizedwebsummit2016?&amp;amp;sort=publicdate&quot;&gt;full archives of all the talks are here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank Brewster Kahle and Wendy Hanamura for organizing the summit, and Kyle Drake of Neocities, Greg Slepak of okTurtles, and John Light of Bitseed for inviting me to attend.  Also thanks to all the other organizers, speakers, and attendees: you’re all awesome.  I really hope that Internet Archive makes this a regular event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>UPNP Vulnerability in Bitcoin Core affects Namecoin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-10-12-upnp-vulnerability&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Core&lt;/a&gt;. It allows an attack from malicious peers in the local network via UPNP. Namecoin is affected, too, so everybody should turn off UPNP until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fix for OpenSSL Consensus Vulnerability has been deployed on 100% of mining hashpower</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fix for OpenSSL Consensus Vulnerability has been deployed on 100% of mining hashpower.  Users of NamecoinQ (i.e. namecoind/Namecoin-Qt 0.3.x) are on semi-SPV security, and should wait for at least 6 confirmations for incoming transactions.  Users of Namecoin Core (in beta) are on full-node security.  Thanks to the miners for their quick action and everyone else who assisted in the response.&lt;/p&gt;
