        <title>Namecoin TLS for Firefox: Phase 1 (Overrides in C++)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Making TLS work for Namecoin websites in Firefox has been an interesting challenge.  On the positive side, Mozilla has historically exposed a number of API’s that would be useful for this purpose, and we’ve actually produced a couple of Firefox extensions that used them: the well-known Convergence for Namecoin codebase (based on Convergence by Moxie Marlinspike and customized for Namecoin by me), and the much-lesser-known nczilla (written by Hugo Landau and me, with some code borrowed from Selenium).  This was a pretty big advantage over Chromium, whose developers have consistently refused to support our use cases (which forced us to use the dehydrated certificate witchcraft).  On the negative side, Mozilla has a habit of removing useful API’s approximately as fast as we notice new ones.  (Convergence’s required API’s were removed by Mozilla about a year or two after we started using Convergence, and nczilla’s required API’s were removed before nczilla even had a proper release, which is why nearly no one has heard of nczilla.)  On the positive side, Mozilla has expressed an apparent willingness to entertain the idea of merging officially supported API’s for our use case.  So, I’ve been hacking around with a fork of Firefox, hoping to come up with something that Mozilla could merge in the future.  Phase 1 of that effort is now complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I’ve created a C++ XPCOM component (compiled into my fork of Firefox) that hooks the certificate verification functions, and can produce both positive and negative overrides (meaning, respectively, that it can make invalid certs appear valid, and make valid certs appear invalid).  This XPCOM component has access to most of the data that we would want: it has access to the certificate, the hostname, and quite a lot of other data that Firefox stores in objects that the XPCOM component has access to.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t yet have access to the full certificate chain (I’m still investigating how to do that), and it also doesn’t yet have access to the proxy settings (I do see how to do that, it’s just not coded yet).  The full certificate chain would be useful if you want to run your own CA; the proxy settings would be useful for Tor stream isolation with headers-only Namecoin SPV clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance is likely to be impacted, since this code is not even close to optimized (nor is performance even measured).  I’ll be investigating performance later.  Short-term, my next step will be to delegate the override decisions to JavaScript code.  (This looks straightforward, but as we all know, our friend Murphy might strike at any time.)  After that I’ll be looking at making that JavaScript code delegate decisions to WebExtensions.  The intention here is to support use cases besides Namecoin’s.  The WebExtensions API that this would expose would presumably be useful for DNSSEC/DANE verification, perspective verification, and maybe other interesting experiments that I haven’t thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major thanks to David Keeler from Mozilla for answering some questions in IRC that I had about how the Firefox certificate verification code is structured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I’ll have more news on this subject in the next couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Refactoring the Raw Transaction API</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Several improvements are desirable for how Namecoin Core creates name transactions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Register names without having to unlock the wallet twice, 12 blocks apart.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coin Control (a method of improving anonymity).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specifying a fee based on when you need the transaction to be confirmed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pure name transactions (a method of improving scalability of Namecoin by decreasing transaction size).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these improvements, though they seem quite different in nature, have one important thing in common: they need to use the raw transaction API in ways that Namecoin Core doesn’t make easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-raw-transaction-api&quot;&gt;What’s the raw transaction API?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the raw transaction API is a Bitcoin Core feature that allows the user to create custom transactions at a much lower level than what a typical user would want.  The raw transaction API gives you a lot of power and flexibility, but it’s also more cumbersome and, if used incorrectly, you can accidentally lose lots of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-those-features-need-the-raw-transaction-api&quot;&gt;Why do those features need the raw transaction API?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raw transaction API is useful for a few reasons.  First, it lets you create and sign transactions independently from broadcasting them.  That means you can create and sign a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name_firstupdate&lt;/code&gt; transaction before its preceding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name_new&lt;/code&gt; transaction has been broadcast.  Second, it gives you direct control over the inputs, outputs, and fees for the transaction, whereas the standard name commands instead pick defaults for you that you might not like and can’t change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-wrong-with-namecoin-cores-raw-transaction-api&quot;&gt;What’s wrong with Namecoin Core’s raw transaction API?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not raw enough!  First off, the only name transactions it can create are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name_update&lt;/code&gt;; it can’t create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name_new&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name_firstupdate&lt;/code&gt; transactions.  That rules out handling name registrations, and consequently means that anonymously registering names or controlling the fee for name registrations is a no-go.  Secondly, it can’t create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name_update&lt;/code&gt; outputs with a higher monetary value than the default 0.01 NMC.  That rules out pure name transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-are-we-fixing-this&quot;&gt;How are we fixing this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re making an API change.  Instead of trying to stuff name operation data into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createrawtransaction&lt;/code&gt;, where it doesn’t belong and where it’s extremely difficult to provide the needed flexibility, we’re removing name support from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createrawtransaction&lt;/code&gt; and moving it to a new RPC call, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;namerawtransaction&lt;/code&gt;.  The new workflow replaces the previous &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createrawtransaction&lt;/code&gt; with two steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createrawtransaction&lt;/code&gt; just like you would with Bitcoin, and specify a currency output of 0.01 NMC for where you want the name output to be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;namerawtransaction&lt;/code&gt; to prepend a name operation to the scriptPubKey of the aforementioned currency output.  This has the effect of converting that currency output into a name output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-will-be-the-impact&quot;&gt;What will be the impact?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of the raw transaction API will need to update their code.  If you’re using the raw transaction API to create currency transactions, then this will actually allow you to delete your Namecoin-specific customizations, since it will be just like Bitcoin again.  If you’re using the raw transaction API to create name transactions (this includes people who are doing atomic name trading), you’ll need to refactor your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createrawtransaction&lt;/code&gt;-using code so that it also calls &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;namerawtransaction&lt;/code&gt;.  If you’re a hacker who enjoys experimenting, this new workflow will probably be much more to your liking, as it will allow you to do stuff that you couldn’t easily do before.  And if you’re just an average user of Namecoin-Qt, you’ll probably like the new features that this enables, such as easier registration of names, better privacy, and lower fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whos-involved-in-this-work&quot;&gt;Who’s involved in this work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jeremy Rand wrote a rough spec for the new API.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Daniel Kraft is implementing the changes to the API.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jeremy Rand plans to utilize the new API in proof-of-concept scripts for several use cases (including the above 4 use cases).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brandon Roberts plans to convert Jeremy’s proof-of-concept scripts into GUI features in Namecoin-Qt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was funded in part by NLnet Foundation’s Internet Hardening Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-might-come-later&quot;&gt;What might come later?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Namecoin-Qt support for atomic name trading?  :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BitcoinJ support merged into ncdns-nsis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The ncdns-nsis project, which provides a zero-configuration Windows installer
for Namecoin domain name resolution functionality, has merged SPV support,
implemented via BitcoinJ. This enables Windows machines to resolve &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bit&lt;/code&gt;
domain names without having to download the full Namecoin chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merging this functionality means that Namecoin domain names can be resolved on
Windows client machines with only a minimal chain synchronization and storage
burden, in exchange for a limited reduction in the security level provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installer binaries will be published in due course as remaining ncdns-nsis
issues are concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the BitcoinJ client, run the ncdns-nsis installer and select the SPV
option when asked whether to install a Namecoin node. Run BitcoinJ after
installation and wait for synchronization to complete; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bit&lt;/code&gt; name resolution
is then available.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Video, Slides, and Paper from Namecoin at GCER 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As was &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/06/gcer-2017.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, I represented Namecoin at the 2017 Global Conference on Educational Robotics.  Although GCER doesn’t produce official recordings of their talks, I was able to obtain an amateur recording of my talk from an audience member.  I’ve also posted my slides, as well as my paper from the conference proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that, as this is an amateur recording, the audio quality is not spectacular.  It should also be noted that the audience is rather different from the audiences for whom I usually give Namecoin talks; as a result, the focus of the content is also rather different from my usual Namecoin talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.namecoin.org/files/videos/gcer-2017/Namecoin-GCER-2017-1080p.webm&quot;&gt;The WebM amateur video recording of my talk is here (hosted by Namecoin.org).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/resources/presentations/GCER_2017/Namecoin_GCER_2017_Slides.pdf&quot;&gt;My slides are available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/resources/presentations/GCER_2017/Namecoin_GCER_2017_Paper.pdf&quot;&gt;My paper is available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to the staff and volunteers from KISS Institute for Practical Robotics, who organized GCER.  Especially big thanks to Roger Clement and Steve Goodgame for giving me excellent feedback on the general outline of my paper and talk.  This was an excellent event, and I look forward to the next time I’m able to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ncdns v0.0.4 Released</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve released ncdns v0.0.4.  This release incorporates a bugfix in the madns dependency, which fixes a DNSSEC signing bug.  The ncdns Windows installer in this release also updated the Dnssec-Trigger dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, you can download it at the &lt;a href=&quot;/download/betas/&quot;&gt;Beta Downloads page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was funded by NLnet Foundation’s Internet Hardening Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TLS Support for Chromium on Windows Released</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After quite a bit of code cleanup, we’ve released a new beta of ncdns for Windows, which includes Namecoin-based TLS certificate validation for Chromium, Google Chrome, and Opera on Windows.  This includes both the CryptoAPI certificate injection and NUMS HPKP injection that were discussed previously.  You can download it on the &lt;a href=&quot;/download/betas/&quot;&gt;Beta Downloads page&lt;/a&gt;.  We’ve also posted binaries of ncdns (without install scripts or TLS support) for a number of other operating systems; they’re also linked on the Beta Downloads page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit for this release goes to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jeremy Rand: Cert injection Go implementation; NUMS HPKP injection concept and Go implementation; review of Hugo’s code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hugo Landau: Cert injection NSIS implementation; NUMS HPKP injection NSIS implementation; review of Jeremy’s code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ryan Castellucci: Dehydrated certificates concept+algorithm; NUMS hash algorithm and Python implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was funded by NLnet Foundation’s Internet Hardening Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Namecoin TLS development focus has started to shift toward Firefox TLS support.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>LibreTorNS Merged to Upstream TorNS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Generally I’m of the opinion that it’s better to get patches to other people’s projects merged upstream whenever feasible; accordingly I submitted the LibreTorNS patches upstream.  Happily, meejah has merged the LibreTorNS patches to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meejah/torns&quot;&gt;upstream TorNS&lt;/a&gt;.  That means LibreTorNS is now obsolete, and you should use meejah’s upstream TorNS for testing dns-prop279 going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to meejah for accepting the patch!  Also thanks to meejah for the code review – there was a bug hiding in my initial submitted patch, which is one of the reasons I always prefer getting things reviewed by upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Namecoin's Jeremy Rand will be a speaker at GCER 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I will be speaking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://new.gcer.net/&quot;&gt;2017 Global Conference on Educational Robotics&lt;/a&gt; (July 8-12, 2017).  For those of you unfamiliar with GCER, the audience is mostly a mix of middle school students, high school students, college students, and educators, most of whom are participating in the robotics competitions hosted at GCER (primarily Botball).  I competed in Botball (and the other 2 GCER competitions: KIPR Open and KIPR Aerial) between 2003 and 2015, and that experience (particularly the hacking aspect, which is actively encouraged in all three competitions) was a major factor in why I’m a Namecoin developer.  My talk is an outreach effort, which I hope will result in increased interest in the Botball scene in the areas of privacy, security, and human rights.  My talk (scheduled for July 10) is entitled “Making HTTPS and Anonymity Networks Slightly More Secure (Or: How I’m Using My Botball Skill Set in the Privacy/Security Field)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to KISS Institute for Practical Robotics (which organizes GCER) for suggesting that I give this talk.  Looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;
