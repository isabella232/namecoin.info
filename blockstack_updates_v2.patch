+The Blockstack developers have demonstrated a repeated, consistent history of obfuscating their security model.  Three examples:
+
+1. At launch, Blockstack used a [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) for data storage.  See the opinions of Bitcoin developers [Peter Todd](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=395761.msg5970778;topicseen#msg5970778) and [Greg Maxwell](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=662734.msg7521013;topicseen#msg7521013) about DHT's.  Namecoin developers publicly [warned](https://web.archive.org/web/20150930144501/http://blog.namecoin.org/post/130158040415/onenames-blockstore-is-much-less-secure-than) when Blockstack launched that DHT's were likely to be unsafe in Blockstack.  Quoting the Namecoin blogpost from 2015 Sept. 29:
+  
+> Additionally, DHT-based discovery of storage nodes is one of the classic suggestions of new users as an alternative to DNS seeds, and, originally, IRC-based discovery: it has never been committed because it is trivial to attack DHT-based networks, and partly because once a node is connected, Bitcoin (and thus Namecoin) peer nodes are solicitous with peer-sharing.
+  
+> As an actual data store, DHT as it is classically described runs into issues with non-global or non-contiguous storage, with little to no way to verify the completeness of the data stored therein. With the decoupled headers in OP_RETURN-using transactions in Bitcoin and the data storage in a DHT (or DHT-like) separate network, there is the likelihood of some little-used data simply disappearing entirely from the network. There is no indication of how Blockstore intends to handle this highly-likely failure condition.
+  
+In response to this criticism, Ryan Shea (Blockstack CEO) [stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20151004130708/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3mwtw8/onenames_blockstore_is_much_less_secure_than/) on 2016 Sept. 30:
+  
+> > Using a DHT could mean that data could become inaccessible
+> 
+> The information one gets from the DHT is hash-validated by the record in the blockchain which means you can get it from anywhere without trusting the source. The DHT is just one possible source of information and we have set up mirrors to ensure data redundancy and allow anyone to run a mirror in addition to a DHT node. Further, the data in the DHT gets periodically data mined and re-populated as needed by mirrors, to ensure there is no data loss whatsoever. This has been extensively tested.
+  
+Muneeb Ali (Blockstack CTO) also [stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20151004130708/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3mwtw8/onenames_blockstore_is_much_less_secure_than/) on 2016 Sept. 30 (emphasis in original):
+  
+> Their DHT arguments show a lack of understanding of how Blockstore's storage works. They **incorrectly assume that the DHT doesn't have global state. It does.**
+  
+However, on 2017 Jan. 23, Muneeb Ali (Blockstack CTO) [posted](https://archive.is/KJ3GX) the following (link is not Tor-friendly due to Blockstack apparently blocking the Wayback machine from their forum):
+  
+> Over this weekend (Jan 22), some community members (thanks, Albin!) reported "Data not saved in DHT" error for their profiles. I debugged this issue and turned out that some nodes of our DHT deployment were on a partition. This is very common in DHTs. We've been lucky in our deployment (which started in summer 2015 and has been running continuously since) and haven't experienced partition issues that frequently. This is because of:
+> 
+> 1. Active monitoring of default discovery nodes and throwing more RAM/CPU at the discovery nodes, so it's hard to overwhelm them with requests.
+> 2. Use of a caching layer where even if the underlying DHT network is experiencing, and recovering from, a partition read queries going to nodes that use a caching layer will still work for (heavily) cached data.
+> 3. We can proactively check the blockchain for new data and check if data has propagated on the DHT network (traditional DHTs don't have any such channel where new data writes get broadcasted).
+> 
+> Even with these additional monitoring and caching services, and extra information about new writes, we still experience issues. And the Atlas network described above helps a lot because it's a fundamentally new design which, in my view, is much better than using a traditional DHT for our use case.
+> Anyway, just restored the DHT partition and things are back to normal.
+  
+Blockstack subsequently stopped using a DHT; Muneeb Ali (Blockstack CTO) [stated](https://archive.is/KJ3GX) on 2017 Jan. 13 about why their proposed replacement (a custom P2P network called Atlas) is better than their DHT (emphasis in original):
+  
+> Atlas nodes have a **global view** of the state meaning that they know if they're missing any data items. This is because we use the blockchain to propagate information about new puts (new data items written to the network). This increases reliability a lot because traditional DHT nodes don't even know if they're missing data (there is no global view in traditional DHTs and there are theoretical proofs for that).
+  
+In other words, the exact issue whose existence we pointed out, and he denied, in 2015.
+2. Namecoin developers [pointed out](https://web.archive.org/web/20150930144501/http://blog.namecoin.org/post/130158040415/onenames-blockstore-is-much-less-secure-than) when Blockstack launched that Blockstack was incompatible with SPV.  Ryan Shea (Blockstack CEO) [replied on Reddit](https://web.archive.org/web/20151004130708/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3mwtw8/onenames_blockstore_is_much_less_secure_than/) on 2015 Sept. 30:
+  
+> > Implementing SPV wouldnt be secure as it depends on having all block information
+> 
+> The short version is that blockstore definitely supports lightweight nodes. Well be publishing a blog post on exactly how this works very soon.
+  
+Muneeb Ali (Blockstack CTO) also [claimed](https://web.archive.org/web/20151004130708/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3mwtw8/onenames_blockstore_is_much_less_secure_than/) on 2015 Sept. 30 (emphasis in original):
+  
+> it is **possible to have SPV-like functionality** in Blockstore. We will publish details about it.
+  
+However, the Blockstack developers **already knew** that this was impossible; on 2014 Dec. 12 (before Namecoin developers pointed out the issue), Chris Pacia (an OpenBazaar developer collaborating with Blockstack) [stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20170509074132/https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/issues/1) on the Blockstack issue tracker:
+  
+> OK. I don't think a blockchain-only lightweight proof is possible without an additional consensus mechanism (blockchain). In fact, I think this is why counterparty and mastercoin don't have SPV implementations ― because you can't do it.
+  
+The system that Blockstack ended up releasing was... trusted 3rd-party checkpoint hashes.  Not remotely similar to SPV, and not something that most blockchain developers would refer to as a "lightweight node".
+3. Namecoin developers have pointed out in this FAQ that Onename (Blockstack's centralized web application for registering names) holds users' private keys.  On 2017 Apr. 07, Muneeb Ali (Blockstack CTO) [complained](https://web.archive.org/web/20170509072808/https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin.org/issues/131) about this, stating:
+  
+> Private keys on Onename are encrypted with a password only the user has. So Onename doesn’t technically hold private keys, just encrypted blobs that are useless without the users’ passwords.
+In comparison, Coinbase actually holds private keys. Exchanges can send bitcoin without the user's permission. This is not the case for Onename.
+  
+Namecoin developers initially pointed out that the web server could easily serve malicious Javascript to steal private keys, and therefore Blockstack developers still had access to keys.  However, it turned out to be even worse than that.  Blockstack's own documentation [states](https://web.archive.org/web/20170508084105/https://onename.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207755189-Profile-being-processed-for-new-registrations):
+  
+> For new registration, the Onename webapp registers your username on Blockstack on your behalf and then transfers the ownership to you.
+  
+This implies that the Onename server controls the keys during the registration process, and could easily steal names while they're being registered without serving malicious Javascript.  A quite different picture than what one might imagine from what Muneeb said to us.
+
+We do not think that Blockstack's security model obfuscation is ethical, and we advise against taking their security claims at face value.

 ### How does Namecoin compare to Monero?
 
 Monero's MoneroDNS project is similar in concept to Namecoin.  MoneroDNS's technical differences to Namecoin are similar to Monero's technical differences to Bitcoin.  Monero has had much less technical review than Bitcoin, and merge-mined chains based on Monero have significantly less hashrate security available to them than merge-mined chains based on Bitcoin.  On the other hand, Monero's small size enables them to liberally experiment with more advanced features and cryptography, whereas Bitcoin-based systems like Namecoin are more conservative.  The Namecoin and Monero development teams are cooperating on areas of common interest, as both projects agree that Namecoin and Monero both have a future.
