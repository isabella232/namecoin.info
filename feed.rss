        <title>Progress on reproducibility of ncdns builds</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of work to ensure that all Namecoin software can be built and
distributed in a reproducible fashion, RBM build scripts for ncdns are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hlandau/ncdns-repro&quot;&gt;now
available&lt;/a&gt;. These scripts are currently
experimental, but will become the preferred way to build ncdns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RBM build system is specifically designed to facilitate reproducible builds
and is also commonly used to build Tor Browser. The RBM build scripts for ncdns
build on the existing Tor Browser build system, which will ease future
integration of ncdns with Tor Browser in a reproducible manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was funded by NLnet Foundation’s Internet Hardening Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Electrum: Merkle Checkpoints</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is an explanation of work originally done by Neil Booth and Roger Taylor (for ElectrumX and Electron-Cash), which Namecoin is adapting for use in Electrum and Electrum-NMC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/02/electrum-nmc-checkpointed-auxpow-truncation.html&quot;&gt;last posted about auditing Electrum-NMC’s bandwidth usage&lt;/a&gt;, I had managed to reduce the data transfer of the portion of the blockchain covered by a checkpoint from 3.2 MB per chunk down to 323 KB per chunk.  I hinted then that there was most likely some further optimization that could be done.  Today I’ll briefly describe one of them: Merkle checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockchain, by its nature, is a sequence of blocks where the block at height &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; commits to the block at height &lt;em&gt;N-1&lt;/em&gt;.  From this fact, it follows that if you know the most recent block, you can verify the authenticity of any earlier block by recursively following those commitments until you arrive at the block you want to verify.  Cryptographically knowledgeable readers will recognize this as a particularly inefficient form of a Merkle tree.  For readers who aren’t familiar with Merkle trees, they’re a cryptographic construction by which a single hash can commit to a large number of hashes, via recursive commitments.  Merkle trees come in a wide variety of constructions, but the most common form of a Merkle tree is a balanced binary Merkle tree.  In such a tree, the proof size to connect a given hash to the root hash is logarithmic in terms of the total number of hashes committed to.  Balanced binary Merkle trees are used, for example, to allow a block header to commit to the transactions in a block.  A blockchain is an optimally unbalanced Merkle tree, in which the proof size is linear rather than logarithmic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linear proof size means that, in Electrum today, if I want to prove that header 2016 is committed to by a checkpoint on header 4031, I need to download 2016 headers, which is an unpleasantly large download of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(4031 - 2016 + 1) * 80 = 161280&lt;/code&gt; bytes [1].  Logarithmic proof sizes given by a balanced binary Merkle tree, by contrast, would mean downloading &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ceil(log2(4031)) * 32 + 80 = 464&lt;/code&gt; bytes.  What if the checkpoint is for height 1,000,000?  In that case, it ends up as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ceil(log2(1000000)) * 32 + 80 = 720&lt;/code&gt; bytes.  Naturally, we’d like logarithmic proof sizes rather than linear proof sizes.  Using block headers themselves as Merkle roots can’t achieve this, but there’s nothing whatsoever that prevents us from taking all the historical block headers, and arranging them into a balanced binary Merkle tree.  We could then use the Merkle root as a checkpoint, and thereby gain extremely small proofs that a given header is committed to by a checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what Neil Booth implemented in ElectrumX, as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cp_height&lt;/code&gt; checkpoint system, and which Roger Taylor subsequently implemented in Electron-Cash.  Since Electrum-NMC’s upstream implementation is Electrum, I’ve been working on porting Roger’s Electron-Cash support for Merkle checkpoints to Electrum.  At the moment, I have a pull request undergoing review for upstream Electrum.  I’m hopeful that it will pass peer review soon, at which point I’ll work on merging it to Electrum-NMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Merkle checkpoints are merged to Electrum-NMC, we’ll be able to set a checkpoint on a recent height (rather than the 36-kiloblock-ago height that we currently set), without causing a severe delay on name lookups.  This will be a substantial improvement to Electrum-NMC’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(However, there are additional optimizations that can be made.  More on those in a future post.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was funded by Cyphrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] These figures assume binary encoding, but Electrum’s protocol uses hex encoding, which effectively doubles the byte count of all of these figures.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Namecoin's Daniel Kraft will be a speaker at CloudFest 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Namecoin’s Chief Scientist Daniel Kraft will be a speaker at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudfest.com/agenda&quot;&gt;CloudFest 2019&lt;/a&gt;.  Daniel’s talk, &lt;em&gt;What The Cryptocurrency Boom Missed: The Namecoin Story&lt;/em&gt;, is on March 28th at 10:55 AM in “Ballsaal Berlin”.  The description of his talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To hear Daniel Kraft, the lead engineer of Namecoin, say it – “Bitcoin frees money, Namecoin frees DNS, identities, and other information”. Namecoin is the second oldest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, but it is more than that. It builds a naming system that is decentralised, trustless, secure and has human-readable names. As such, it is the world’s first solution to “Zooko’s triangle”. Applications range from secure management of online identities and cryptographic keys and a decentralised alternative to the DNS and the certificate-authority infrastructure to fully decentralised multiplayer online games. Find out why cryptocurrency technology is so much more than merely an investment, and discover how it is being employed to put greater privacy and security tools into the hands of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>ElectrumX v1.9.2 Released by Upstream, Includes Checkpointed AuxPoW Truncation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx&quot;&gt;Upstream ElectrumX&lt;/a&gt; has released v1.9.2, which includes several Namecoin-related changes (all of which were submitted by me and merged by Neil).  Here’s what’s new for Namecoin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add 2 new servers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the correct default Namecoin Core RPC port; this means ElectrumX server operators won’t need to manually set the RPC port via an environment variable anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/02/electrum-nmc-checkpointed-auxpow-truncation.html&quot;&gt;Checkpointed AuxPoW truncation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a correct &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MAX_SEND&lt;/code&gt; by default for AuxPoW chains.  The previous default of 1 MB doesn’t work with AuxPoW chains because AuxPoW headers are substantially larger than Bitcoin headers; the new default of 10 MB for AuxPoW chains allows Namecoin to sync properly.  This means ElectrumX server operators won’t need to manually set the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MAX_SEND&lt;/code&gt; via an environment variable anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ElectrumX then subsequently released some other revisions, none of which are specific to Namecoin; the latest release is currently v1.9.5.  At least 2 of the 3 public Namecoin ElectrumX servers have already upgraded; as a result, I’ve merged checkpointed AuxPoW truncation into Electrum-NMC’s master branch.  If you run a Namecoin ElectrumX server and haven’t yet upgraded, please consider upgrading to the latest ElectrumX release so that your users will be able to use future releases of Electrum-NMC (which will require checkpointed AuxPoW truncation) without any trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And a reminder that we need more ElectrumX instances… please consider running one if you have a server with spare resources!)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Electrum-NMC: Checkpointed AuxPoW Truncation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I posted previously about &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/11/28/electrum-nmc-checkpoints.html&quot;&gt;auditing Electrum-NMC’s bandwidth usage&lt;/a&gt;.  In that post, I mentioned that there were probably optimizations that could be done to reduce the 3.2 MB per 2016 block headers that get downloaded when looking up a name that’s covered by a checkpoint.  I’ve now implemented one of them: AuxPoW truncation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background: AuxPoW (auxilliary proof of work) is the portion of Namecoin block headers that allows clients to verify that the PoW expended by miners on the parent chain (usually Bitcoin) applies to Namecoin as well.  As a result, SPV clients such as Electrum-NMC (which verify PoW) need to download the AuxPoW data.  However, the AuxPoW data in a Namecoin block header &lt;em&gt;does not contribute to the block hash&lt;/em&gt;.  As a result, the commitment in a Namecoin block header to the previous block header can be verified without having access to any AuxPoW data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter?  AuxPoW is by far the largest part of a Namecoin block header, because it contains a coinbase transaction from the parent chain.  Coinbase transactions can frequently be quite large, especially if the parent block is mined by a mining pool that’s paying a large number of miners via the coinbase transaction.  If we can omit the AuxPoW data from Namecoin block headers, then that saves a lot of bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we can’t get rid of the AuxPoW data completely, since SPV validation requires PoW verification.  But not all blocks are verified via SPV – blocks that are covered by a checkpoint don’t need to have their PoW checked, since the checkpoint implies validity.  So, we can simply not check the AuxPoW for any blocks that are committed to by a checkpoint.  And if we don’t need to check the AuxPoW for such blocks, we don’t need to download it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, the Electrum protocol includes a feature that allows the client to tell the server what height its checkpoint is set to.  This feature isn’t actually used yet in the Electrum client, but we can use that feature to have Electrum-NMC tell ElectrumX what height its checkpoint is set to, such that ElectrumX will then truncate AuxPoW data from the block headers it responds with.  I’ve submitted a PR for ElectrumX that does exactly that: with this PR, ElectrumX truncates AuxPoW data from block headers when the client supplies a checkpoint height that is higher than the height of the block header.  Neil from ElectrumX has already merged my PR; once it’s in a tagged release, I’ll push the relevant changes to Electrum-NMC as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does the data transfer look like now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before: 3.2 MB per 2016 headers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After: 323 KB per 2016 headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s roughly a 90% reduction.  Not bad.  There are probably some additional optimizations that can still be done, but those will have to wait for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Internet Governance Forum 2018 Summary</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As was &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/11/09/internet-governance-forum-2018.html&quot;&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, I (Jeremy Rand) represented Namecoin at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/&quot;&gt;Internet Governance Forum 2018&lt;/a&gt; in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My panel at IGF (moderated by Chiara Petrioli from Università degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza) went reasonably well, and a quite diverse set of perspectives were represented.  I suspect that a lot of the attendees had never been exposed to the cypherpunk philosophy of “trusted third parties are security holes” (credit to Nick Szabo for that phrasing), and I hope I did a good job of providing that exposure so that maybe we’ll have some new allies.  As with ICANN58, I continued my adherence to the Fluffypony way of answering questions: don’t hype things, and always be quick to admit disadvantages.  This worked well at ICANN, and I think it worked well at IGF.  (Special thanks to the guy from Verisign who asked a question in the Q&amp;amp;A that will shortly be immortalized in the Namecoin.org FAQ!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IGF has published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/igf-2018-day-1-salle-vi-ws408-dns-enhancements-and-alternatives-for-the-future-internet&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;[1], a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyTNAXdd7Qc&amp;amp;pbjreload=10&quot;&gt;video recording&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/igf-2018-ws-408-dns-enhancements-and-alternatives-for-the-future-internet&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.  The transcript and report should work fine in Tor Browser at High Security settings; the video recording can be viewed via &lt;a href=&quot;https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/&quot;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://packages.debian.org/stretch/youtube-dl&quot;&gt;Debian package&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.whonix.org/t/vlc-apparmor-profile-wip-streaming-documentation-for-whonix-install-youtube-dl-by-default/2918&quot;&gt;recommendation by Whonix&lt;/a&gt;) if you don’t trust YouTube’s JavaScript (and there’s no reason why you should trust YouTube’s JavaScript!).  I’ve also posted &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/presentations/IGF_2018/Namecoin_IGF_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;my slides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, I was on a panel hosted by Jean-Christophe Finidori.  This one was a bit more in my comfort zone, as the attendees were mostly blockchain enthusiasts, and there were a lot of quite sophisticated questions about the details of Namecoin’s design.  Unfortunately, I’m not aware of any recordings of this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I had lots of other meetings while I was in Paris, but as usual, I won’t be publicly disclosing the content of those conversations, because I want people to be able to talk to me at conferences without worrying that off-the-cuff comments will be broadcast to the public.  That said, the result of one of those conversations is likely to be posted very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Chiara and Jean-Christophe for inviting me; I enjoyed visiting Paris!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Reading the official transcript makes me realize how lucky I am that I’m not hearing-impaired.  Hearing-impaired people are going to have a miserable time trying to understand the transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
